# Alano Club Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a Django web application for Alano Club member management, replacing their existing desktop application with a web-based interface accessible from any device.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Django 4.2+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Package Manager**: UV (not pip)
- **Virtual Environment**: `.venv` 
- **Testing**: pytest (implementing)
- **Deployment**: Render (planned)

## Critical Setup Requirements

### Virtual Environment
**ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before any Python operations:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Package Management
**Use UV for all package operations:**
```bash
# Sync packages from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Add new packages
uv add package-name
```

### Database Connection
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Connection Variable**: `DATABASE_URL` (set in `.env` file)
- **Configuration**: Uses `dj-database-url` for Django integration
- **Required**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is properly configured before running Django commands

## Development Workflow Preferences

### Communication Style
1. **Always explain before executing** - Print out what you're going to do before doing it
2. **Show commands before running** - Display the exact command that will be executed
3. **Step-by-step approach** - Break complex tasks into simple, manageable steps
4. **Keep it simple** - Prefer straightforward solutions over complex ones

### Testing Approach
- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-django
- **Philosophy**: Build tests as we develop features
- **Coverage**: Use pytest-cov for test coverage tracking

## Key Project Files
- `manage.py` - Django management commands
- `.env` - Environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY)
- `pyproject.toml` - uv project dependencies
- `members/` - Main app for member management
- `data/` - Excel/CSV data files for import

## Data Context
The project involves importing existing member data from CSV files:
- Member records (~325)
- Payment history (~1,337 records)
- Member types and payment methods
- Historical data and relationships

## Example Workflow
When implementing new features:
1. Explain what we're building
2. Show the command to be executed
3. Ask for permission to modify the files accordings
4. Execute step by step
5. Test the implementation
6. Verify everything works before moving to next step
